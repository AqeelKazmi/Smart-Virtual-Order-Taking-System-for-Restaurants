## Introduction
As our software’s name (Smart Virtual Order Taking System For Restaurants) tells that its all about the virtuality of a system. Virtual Restaurant Management system is actually a concept of converting Traditional Hotel Management System into some Virtual System. By applying Virtual Restaurant system, Traditional systems of selecting menu, ordering dishes, placing order, taking order, showing up the best ones, getting total bill, paying bill  will be change.

And after completing their meal they can give their suggestions about the chef, staff and the quality of order/food. The software can check the response of customer whether it is positive, negative or neutral through ##Sentiment analysis and this technology can aware the restaurant owner about the public opinion related to the quality of stuff(chef, food, services etc), which is very beneficial in business sense for the restaurant.
